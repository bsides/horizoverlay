This is a fork that:
* Provides Direct, Critical, and "Direct Critical" hit rates.
* Can combine pets internally to maintain compatibility with MopiMopi, if you are running them side by side.

From kzVee:
* Keeps track of # of deaths per player.
* Display players by their job color. (Colors used for each job match those used in [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com).)
* Extra highlight option for Self.

From Ladish:
* Fixes a bug in the combatant filter.
