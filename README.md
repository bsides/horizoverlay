## URL CHANGED AGAIN, PLEASE UPDATE TO `https://bsides.github.io/horizoverlay`

A simple horizontal damage meter [overlay](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin) for Final Fantasy XIV. It currently shows player dps, damage %, hps, encounter duration and total dps. Based on [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6q41r3/what_act_overlay_is_this_snipped_off_of_a_stream/).

## Example setup
This is how it should be showing for you after setup with everything checked
![Horizoverlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-allbyrole.jpg "Horizoverlay")

## Install
### __Please notice the URL has changed from v1!__
1. Please, be sure you are running version 0.3.3.13 or higher of hibiyasleep Overlay plugin: https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases | [Version x64](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/download/0.3.3.13/OverlayPlugin-0.3.3.13-x64-full.zip) | [Version x86](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/download/0.3.3.13/OverlayPlugin-0.3.3.13-x86-full.zip) |

2. Just paste this url into the overlay's url field:
`https://bsides.github.io/horizoverlay` and click in the _Reload Overlay_ button. You should see something like this:

![First Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-initial.png "First Screen of Horizoverlay")

3. Now would be the right time to resize the window to something like 70% of your screen's width.

![Resize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-resize.png)

4. Right click in the text to open Settings!

![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-window.png "Horizoverlay Settings")
If you can't see the Settings window, just alt tab until you do.

## Credits & other Magicked KnickerKnacks
It's based of the amazing work [of this repo](https://github.com/billyvg/OverlayPlugin-themes) that tries to compile a whole bunch of [Overlay](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin) themes together. Thanks to its repo's `testing.js` file (and [/u/rdmty](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdmty)), I was able to mock the data that ACT throws and built this theme.

The background image from the config window was made by [Richard Tabor](https://purtypixels.com/) and was taken from [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/).

Thanks to [@bmwang](https://github.com/bmwang) for introducing more options and color themes.

A lot of inspiration from [Kagerou](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/kagerou) overlay by [@hibiyasleep](https://github.com/hibiyasleep).

A very special thanks for [@yorushika](https://github.com/yorushika) to translating into Simplified / Traditional Chinese!!!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Special thanks to [my awesome boyfriend](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/2834234/), who test everything everytime I ask ‚ù§
